    <p class = "description">Steak frites, meaning steak and fries in French, is a dish that consists of steak and French fries. 
        Originating from Belgium and may also be consider the country's national dish, it is one of my favourite meals to cook for anybody I decide to cook for the first time.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by salting your steak on a racked wire or plate and place it in the fridge</li>
        <li>Then, cut your potatoes into fry shapes about an inch thick (I prefer to leave the skin on, but you can peel them if you would like)</li>
        <li>Next, rinse your fries in water until the water runs clear</li>
        <li>Pat your fries dry on a paper towel and set them aside</li>
        <li>Fill a pot or deepfryer with enough oil to cook your fries in</li>
        <li>Once the pot or fryer is at about 350 F, drop your fries in</li>
        <li>Next, start preheating a pan until the pan is hot enough to evaporate water slowly but not instantaneously</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of oil to the pan and swirl it around so most of pan's surface is covered in oil</li>
        <li>Place the steak on the pan and make sure the entire bottom surface makes contact with the pan</li>
        <li>Flip the steak once it unsticks from the pan</li>
        <li>While the steak is searing on the other side, take the fries out of the oil and place on a wired rack</li>
        <li>Once both sides of the steak are seared, turn the heat down to low</li>
        <li>Put the fries back in the oil so they can have a second fry to reach desired crisp</li>
        <li>Throw a slice of butter in the pan with a few garlic cloves and a sprig of thyme</li>
        <li>Start basting the steak in the infused butter</li>
        <li>Take the steak out once it is done to desired temperature and place on a cutting board</li>
        <li>Pour the pan drippings onto the steak and allow the steak to rest for the same amount of time you cooked it for</li>
        <li>Take the fries out of the oil and lay on wired rack</li>
        <li>Instantly salt the fries</li>
        <li>Cut the steak to desired thickness</li>
        <li>Place the fries onto a plate as well as the steak on top of it and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
